# Description

The goal is to upload a photo, and then convert it to a matrix of 1x1 Lego pieces (either plates or tiles).

The entire photo should be squared, and could fit various Lego board sizes.


## Connection with BrickLink

BrickLink is a website where you can buy Lego pieces by unit. This app should build a basket with needed pieces.

## Future upgrade
Add relief to some pieces (by using smoother pieces)
